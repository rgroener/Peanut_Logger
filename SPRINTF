By default, the minimalistic printf library is used, which doesn't support floating point numbers and results in a "?" as a placeholder for the value. You have to tell the linker to use the floating point library.

For example (from GNU makefile)

PRINTF_LIB_MIN = -Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_min

You have to use the floating point version like so:

PRINTF_LIB_FLOAT = -Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_flt

Depending on your base makefile, there should already be a section like this:

# If this is left blank, then it will use the Standard printf version.
PRINTF_LIB = 
#PRINTF_LIB = $(PRINTF_LIB_MIN)
#PRINTF_LIB = $(PRINTF_LIB_FLOAT)

Just uncomment the line containing PRINTF_LIB_FLOAT.
